# Where is the math in Tennis Rackets by Paulina Fuentes
A mathematical model describes the simply dynamic of the tennis racket in order to understand the main characteristics to be involved
Description of the problem:
Tennis is one of the most popular sports with rackets, that is why my proposal to this project is to focus on studying the movement of the racket in tennis, focusing on how its structure behaves during ball impact. 

Personal motivation:
For this project, I am exploring the intersection of two of my main interests. First, tennis, a sport I began practicing when I arrived at university and quickly fell in love with. Second, mechanical engineering, the field I am studying, which makes it especially interesting for me to understand mechanical applications and how design affects performance.

Math classes taken:
Precalculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, Calculus III and Statistics for Engineers.

Focus:
I am interested in the mathematical model. I believe that fully understanding the mathematics and physics behind rackets not only allows players to choose a racket that suits their play style, but also helps in designing and building better rackets.

In the video we can understand how different physical properties affect the performance when playing.
