# Where is the math in Tennis Rackets by Paulina Fuentes
## Description of the Problem

Tennis is one of the most popular racket sports. For this reason, my proposal for this project is to study the movement of the tennis racket by analizing a mathematical model with a second-order differential equation that models the motion of the ball's center of mass during impact with the racket, considering damping and restoring force, focusing on how its structure behaves during ball impact.

## Personal Motivation

For this project, I am exploring the intersection of two of my main interests. First, tennis, a sport I began practicing when I arrived at university and quickly fell in love with. Second, mechanical engineering, the field I am studying, which makes it especially interesting for me to understand mechanical applications and how design affects performance.

## Math Classes Taken

- Precalculus  
- Calculus I  
- Calculus II  
- Calculus III  
- Statistics for Engineers  

## Focus

I am interested in the mathematical model. I believe that fully understanding the mathematics and physics behind rackets not only allows players to choose a racket that suits their play style, but also helps in designing and building better rackets.
