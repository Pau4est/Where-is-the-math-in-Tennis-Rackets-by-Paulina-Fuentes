# Where is the math in Tennis Rackets by Paulina Fuentes
## Description of the Problem

Tennis is one of the most popular racket sports. For this reason, my proposal for this project is to study the movement of the tennis racket by analizing a mathematical model with a second-order differential equation that models the motion of the ball's center of mass during impact with the racket, considering damping and restoring force, focusing on how its structure behaves during ball impact.

## About Me
I am a mechanical systems engineer. Two years ago I began university together with my love for tennis. Right now I am the president of the Tennis Club of my university. Regularly I organize events and teach tennis basics to beginners. That is why I can say from firsthand experience that the rackets, which in principle can look like simple tools, involve a complexity, and it is really useful to comprehend how they work to choose properly according to the level, play style, body necessities, and economic variables. This work is important, so with the proper tools I can provide more information for the club and community in general.

## Personal Motivation
For this project, I am exploring the intersection of two of my main interests. First, tennis, a sport I began practicing when I arrived at university and quickly fell in love with. Second, mechanical engineering, the field I am studying, which makes it especially interesting for me to understand mechanical applications and how design affects performance.

## Math Classes Taken
- Precalculus  
- Calculus I  
- Calculus II  
- Calculus III  
- Statistics for Engineers  

## Focus
I am interested in the mathematical model. I believe that fully understanding the mathematics and physics behind rackets not only allows players to choose a racket that suits their play style, but also helps in designing and building better rackets.

## Conclusion
This project focused on the mathematical modeling of the dynamics between a tennis ball and a racket, specifically analyzing it with second-order differential equations derived from Newton's Second Law, which models the forces acting on the tennis ball as it compresses and rebounds off the string bed.

My previous knowledge of physics and calculus helped me follow what is happening behind the equations, though I faced challenges understanding how real-world systems like damping and stiffness are mathematically approximated. I also had to learn how to apply numerical tools and simulations to test the model.

One of the biggest challenges was interpreting the academic papers, considering that I didn't have a sufficient level of mathematics to understand them, and that required an understanding of each of the factors involved to explain it in a much simpler way.

I enjoyed working and reading on the topic, not only because it was easier for me to grasp the idea of the physical phenomena occurring, but also because I could easily relate it to my experience. I recognize that the level of mathematics required to fully understand the subject is necessary; however, I see it as an excellent opportunity to make the most of my upcoming courses and understand the true value and application of what I learn. On the other hand, I consider my model to be simple enough to introduce the complexity of racket dynamics, but it is essential to add more variables such as climate or shot angle to better complement the work. I am aware that I will soon cover and expand my understanding of systems of differential equations, numerical methods, and their applications in real-life equipment design in order to attack the same problem with more tools that will allow me a deeper understanding and, in the future, propose a more complete model, both numerically and for simulations.
